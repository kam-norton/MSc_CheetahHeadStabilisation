## üìñ Project Overview

This repository contains the research code and supporting material for **Cheetah Head Stabilisation**, part of Kamryn Norton's MSc project at the University of Cape Town.  

The project investigates how cheetahs stabilise their heads during passive induced motion and active high-speed locomotion using a combination of **multi-camera markerless motion capture, optimisation methods,** and **3D motion analysis**. The aim is to build a reproducible workflow that bridges biomechanics and computer vision to quantify head dynamics relative to the body and environment.

## üóÇ Repository Structure

The repository is being structured to follow the chapters of the MSc thesis. Each section will include code, data-processing scripts, and analysis relevant to that part of the research.

Planned sections:

- **Chapter 3 ‚Äì Data Collection**  
  Scripts for importing, calibrating, and synchronising multi-camera and IMU recordings. Inclusive of code and scripts for DeepLabCut labelling. 

- **Chapter 4 ‚Äì 3D Reconstruction**  
  Code to reconstruct the 2D video recordings into 3D motion capture videos.

- **Chapter 5 ‚Äì Head Stabilisation Analysis**  
  Code for the analysis of head stabilisation in 3D. Tools for generating figures, plots, and animations.
